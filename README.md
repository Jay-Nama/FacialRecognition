# Facial Recognition System in Python

This project implements a **real-time facial recognition system** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, and Albumentations.  
The system was trained on a custom dataset of images taken of our group (3 participants). Each image was annotated with bounding boxes and labels (`JayFace`, etc.) using **LabelMe**, then augmented to improve robustness.  
The final trained model detects and recognizes faces in live webcam video, drawing bounding boxes around each face and displaying the personâ€™s name.

Note: The dataset (pictures + LabelMe annotations) is private and not included in this repository. The scripts will not run directly without creating your own dataset. Instead, this repo demonstrates the **workflow, code, and methodology** behind our project.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Custom dataset (~3250 images) created from pictures of our team  
- Bounding box annotations with **LabelMe**  
- Dataset augmentation (flipping, cropping, brightness, etc.) via **Albumentations**  
- CNN architecture based on pretrained **VGG16**  
- Dual-branch network for **classification** and **bounding box regression**  
- Real-time detection via **OpenCV** with labels displayed above faces  
- Achieved **93% accuracy, 94% precision, 95% recall, and 95% F1-score**

## ðŸ“¸ Visuals / Demo
### Example Workflow:
Note: Images were used in all kinds of settings like dim lighs, bright lights, face fully visible, face fully cut off, face half cut off, etc.
